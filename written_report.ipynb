        "This project explores how audio features influence the success of top Spotify songs from 2023. A statistical test comparing danceability between charted and non-charted songs found no significant difference. To further investigate, a logistic regression model was built to predict playlist inclusion using features like energy, danceability, and acousticness. Energy stood out as the strongest predictor, showing a clear link to playlist success. While model accuracy was moderate (57%), the findings suggest that high-energy songs are more likely to gain visibility on Spotify."
